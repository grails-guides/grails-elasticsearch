If you do not already have Docker installed, you’ll need to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[install it].

Depending on your environment you may need to increase Docker’s available memory to 4GB or more.

* Make sure Docker machine is running by executing following command:
[source, bash]
----
docker-machine status default
----

* If `default` Docker machine is not running then start the machine by executing following bash command:
[source,bash]
----
docker-machine start default
----

After executing the above command you should see something on the terminal as follows:

[soruce, bash]
----
Starting "default"...
(default) Check network to re-create if needed...
(default) Waiting for an IP...
Machine "default" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.
----

* Now we have started Docker machine successfully. So let's note down the IP address of `default` Docker machine, which we will use in future to connect our application to the Elasticsearch. Run the following command to see IP address of Docker machine:

[source, bash]
----
docker-machine ls
NAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
default   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v17.12.0-ce
----

* Start the Elasticsearch Docker container

[source, bash]
----
eval $(docker-machine env default)

docker run \
    -p 9200:9200 \
    -p 9300:9300 \
    -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
    -e ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m" \
    -e "http.cors.enabled=true" \
    -e "http.cors.allow-origin=/https?:\/\/192.168.99.100(:[0-9]+)?/" \
    -e "http.cors.allow-headers=Authorization,X-Requested-With,Content-Length,Content-Type" \
    -e "http.cors.allow-credentials=true" \
    -e "cluster.name=elasticsearch" \
    -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.4.3
