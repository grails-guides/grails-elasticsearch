Functional tests require the app to be running, and are designed to exercise the application almost as a user would, by making HTTP requests against it. These tend to be the most complex tests to write.

TIP: The testing framework used by Grails is http://spockframework.org/[Spock]. Spock provides an expressive syntax for writing test cases, based on the Groovy language, and so is a great fit for Grails. It includes a JUnit runner, which means IDE support is effectively universal (any IDE that can run JUnit tests can run Spock tests).

Following is the functional tests for `search` action of `BookController.groovy`
