In order to create the index for this domain in Elasticsearch, define a `static` property called `searchable` in the previoulsy defined `Book` domain class

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/Book.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/Book.groovy[tag=searchable]
----

<1> 'boost' is commonly used to fine-tune the the relevance `_score` for each document by giving more weight to documents. In this case, if the search query matches with the `title` of the document then the relevance `_score` of the document will be double when compared to other results.

<2> If the search query matches with the `about` field then the relevant `_score` will be `1.0` times the others results.

<3> The `href` property is included in the list of properties that are not `searchable`.


The previous example will create the following Elasticsearch mappings:

[source, json]
----
{
  "mappings": {
    "book": {
      "properties": {
        "author": {
          "include_in_all": true,
          "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
          "type": "text"
        },
        "about": {
          "include_in_all": true,
          "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
          "type": "text"
        },
        "title": {
          "include_in_all": true,
          "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
          "boost": 2,
          "type": "text"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
