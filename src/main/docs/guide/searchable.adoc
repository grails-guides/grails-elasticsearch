In order to create index for this domain in Elasticsearch, define a `static` property called `searchable` in the previoulsy defined `Book` domain class

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/Book.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/Book.groovy[tag=searchable]

<1> 'boost' is commonly used to fine-tune the relevance `_score` for each document by giving more weight to documents. In this case, if the search query matches with `title` of document than relevance `_score` of the document will be double as compared other results.

<2> If the search query match with the `about` field than the relevant `_score` will be `1.0` times the others results.

<3> Properties `href` is not `searchable`.


The above will create following Elasticsearch mappings:
